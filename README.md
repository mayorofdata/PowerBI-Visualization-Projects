# PowerBI Visualization Projects
## Background
In this repository, we go over some of the visualizations I've created personally and by participating in London Business Analytics Group Projects using PowerBI. 

## Examples
Below are some of the project previews. Click on the links to view the full description of the each project
### [Preparing a dataset for Machine Learning in Power BI](https://github.com/mayorofdata/PowerBI-Visualization-Projects/tree/master/Preparing%20a%20dataset%20for%20Machine%20Learning%20in%20Power%20BI)
We explore a famous machine learning dataset, the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) data, to see if it is possible to build a model with some predictive power.  We visualise the data as histogram, box and whisker plot and a ‘home-made’ swarm plot.  To do this, we need to shape the dataset in the Query Editor and standardise the data with a few DAX calculations. Below are some of the visuals

### [Visualizing and Analysis Of Telecommunication Data](https://github.com/mayorofdata/PowerBI-Visualization-Projects/tree/master/Visualizing%20and%20Analysis%20Of%20Telecommunication%20Data)
Using PowerBI, I visualize and analyse the Telecommunication dataset to gain insight into customer attrition and make business decisions. I created few visuals to understand why customers are churning the comapny. Using Key Influencer visual, I was able to gain insight into the key attributes that makes customers churn the comapny and also the combined attributes impact on customer attrition using Top segment of the Key Influencer visual. These attributes are later used for [prediction with Python](https://github.com/mayorofdata/Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression).
