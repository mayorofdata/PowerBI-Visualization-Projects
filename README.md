# PowerBI Visualization Projects
## Background
In this repository, we go over some of the visualizations I've created by participating in London Business Analytics Group Projects. From popular community data & analytics meetup, the group analyses and visualizes interesting public and open source datasets using  Power BI, R, SQL and Python. 

## Examples
Below are some of the project previews
### [Preparing a dataset for Machine Learning in Power BI](https://github.com/mayorofdata/PowerBI-Visualization-Projects/tree/master/Preparing%20a%20dataset%20for%20Machine%20Learning%20in%20Power%20BI)
We explore a famous machine learning dataset, the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) data, to see if it is possible to build a model with some predictive power.  We visualise the data as histogram, box and whisker plot and a ‘home-made’ swarm plot.  To do this, we need to shape the dataset in the Query Editor and standardise the data with a few DAX calculations. Below are some of the visuals
