# PowerBI Visualization Projects
## Background
In this repository, we go over some of the visualizations I've created personally and by participating in London Business Analytics Group Projects using PowerBI. 

## Examples
Below are some of the project previews. Click on the links to view the full description of each project
### [Preparing a dataset for Machine Learning in Power BI](https://github.com/mayorofdata/PowerBI-Visualization-Projects/tree/master/Preparing%20a%20dataset%20for%20Machine%20Learning%20in%20Power%20BI)
We explore a famous machine learning dataset, the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) data, to see if it is possible to build a model with some predictive power.  We visualise the data as histogram, box and whisker plot and a ‘home-made’ swarm plot.  To do this, we need to shape the dataset in the Query Editor and standardise the data with a few DAX calculations. Below are some of the visuals

### [Visualizing and Analysis Of Telecommunication Data](https://github.com/mayorofdata/PowerBI-Visualization-Projects/tree/master/Visualizing%20and%20Analysis%20Of%20Telecommunication%20Data)
Using PowerBI, I visualize and analyse the Telecommunication dataset to gain insight into customer attrition and make business decisions. I created few visuals to understand why customers are churning the comapny. Using Key Influencer visual, I was able to gain insight into the key attributes that makes customers churn the comapny and also the combined attributes impact on customer attrition using Top segment of the Key Influencer visual. These attributes are later used for [prediction with Python](https://github.com/mayorofdata/Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression).

### [Cleaning and Visualizing Titanic Dataset](https://github.com/mayorofdata/PowerBI-Visualization-Projects/tree/master/Cleaning%20and%20Visualizing%20Titanic%20Dataset)
Using PowerBI, I clean up a famous dataset - a passenger list from the Titanic. Using Power BI's Query editor, I rename some columns, split others apart, add new columns and replace obscure values with more meaningful ones. I then create a few visuals to understand who survived and why - was it women and children first or were other factors important? I build  ribbon charts to show the age profile  and use the Key Influencer visual. I employ interactive techniques such as cross-highlighting and drill-through pages to get more insight.

### [Visualizing the English Premier League Table with Power BI](https://github.com/mayorofdata/PowerBI-Visualization-Projects/tree/master/Visualizing%20the%20English%20Premier%20League%20Table%20with%20Power%20BI)
English Premier League(EPL) is my favorite football league and I am a supporter of Manchester United. Using dataset from EPL websites, I build an EPL interactive league table with PowerBI. To achieve this, I used the Query Editor to split, reshape, sort, append, calculate on then group the data. I then built the table visualisation, then improve it with conditional formatting and custom tooltips to provide additional information of each team when one hover on it.
