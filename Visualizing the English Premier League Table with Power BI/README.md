### [Visualizing the English Premier League Table with Power BI](https://github.com/mayorofdata/PowerBI-Visualization-Projects/tree/master/Visualizing%20the%20English%20Premier%20League%20Table%20with%20Power%20BI)
English Premier League(EPL) is my favorite football league and I am a supporter of Manchester United. Using dataset from EPL websites, I build an EPL interactive league table with PowerBI. To achieve this, I used the Query Editor to split, reshape, sort, append, calculate on then group the data. I then built the table visualisation, then improve it with conditional formatting and custom tooltips to provide additional information of each team when one hover on it.
