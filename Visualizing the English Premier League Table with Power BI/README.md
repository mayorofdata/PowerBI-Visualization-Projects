Starting with the match record of this season's English Premier League games, we'll build a league table. To do this, we'll use the Query Editor to split, reshape, sort, append, calculate on then group the data. We'll build our table visualisation, then improve it with conditional formatting and custom tooltips.

The datasets and course materials are in at https://bit.ly/33zWQtp in the "Football" folder.
