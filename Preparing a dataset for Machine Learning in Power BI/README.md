# Preparing a dataset for Machine Learning in Power BI
We explore a famous machine learning dataset, the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) data, to see if it is possible to build a model with some predictive power.  We visualise the data as histogram, box and whisker plot and a ‘home-made’ swarm plot.  To do this, we need to shape the dataset in the Query Editor and standardise the data with a few DAX calculations. Below are some of the visuals
